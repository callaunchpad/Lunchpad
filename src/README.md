# Lunchpad
Spring 2023 internal project

Goals: 
1. Create pipeline for hardcoded StableDiffusion prompt using name of food + list of ingredients, then pass into inversecooking model
2. Directly use guided image-to-image StableDiffusion to do style transfer, run inference using inversecooking model
3. Add in option to add other ingredients into StableDiffusion prompt
4. Add in option to add both closest and farthest ingredient in latent space.
5. Understand and visualize latent space that is learned from ingredient decoder.
